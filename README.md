# Billionaire MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI assistants launch coins on Ethereum and manage crypto wallets.

## What is this?

This server connects AI assistants (like Claude) to the [Billionaire](https://billionaires.com) platform, enabling:

- **Wallet Management** - Create encrypted Ethereum wallets, check balances, transfer ETH
- **Coin Launching** - Deploy ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum mainnet with built-in liquidity
- **Fee Collection** - Earn 1% of every trade on coins you launch, forever
- **Listings** - Browse and search all launched coins

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Earn forever** - You get 1% of every trade on your coin
